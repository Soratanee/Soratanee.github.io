            <p1><strong>Monkey D. Luffy</strong> (/ˈluːfi/ LOO-fee) (Japanese: モンキー・D・ルフィ, Hepburn: Monkī Dī Rufi, [ɾɯɸiː]), also known as<strong>"Straw Hat" Luffy </strong>[n 2], is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the One Piece manga series, created by Eiichiro Oda. Luffy made his debut as a young boy who acquires the properties of rubber after accidentally eating one of the devil fruits the Gum Gum Fruit, originally known as the Human-Human Fruit, Model: Nika</p1>
            <p2>Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, and dreamt of being a pirate since childhood from the influence of his idol and mentor Red-Haired Shanks. At the age of 17, Luffy sets sail from the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure, One Piece, to succeed Gol D. Roger as "King of the Pirates".</p2>
            <p3>He fights antagonists, and aids and befriends the inhabitants of several islands on his journey. Usually cheerful, he becomes serious and even aggressive when he fights. Luffy uses his elasticity to concentrate his power, executing a range of attacks. In his signature attack, Gum-Gum Pistol, he slingshots punches at opponents from a distance. Luffy also grows stronger over the course of the story, as reflected in his "bounty", which is used to measure the threat he poses to the World Government. He is the grandson of Monkey D. Garp, who is a vice-admiral; the son of Monkey D. Dragon, who is the leader of the Revolutionary Army;[10], and sworn brother of Portgas D. Ace and Sabo.[11]</p3>
            <p4>Luffy appears in most of the episodes, films, television specials, and OVAs of the manga's anime adaptations and several of the franchise's video games. Due to the series' international popularity, Luffy is one of the world's most recognizable manga and anime characters. In addition to the One Piece franchise, the character appears in a number of manga and anime series and collaborative video games. His critical reception is largely positive</p4>

    <h2>Creation and conception</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p1>When Eiichiro Oda created Luffy, he strove for a "manliness" similar to that of Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball series.[12] Oda said that he named his main character "Luffy" because he felt that the name suited him. When he later learned about the sailing term, "luffing", he was delighted by the coincidence.[13] In his prototype one-shots, "Romance Dawn", Oda refined the artistic style and story elements before publishing the final product a year later as the first chapter of One Piece. In the second version of "Romance Dawn", Luffy resembled his design at the beginning of the series.[14] After the one-shot of One Piece was made, Oda contacted his former mentor, Nobuhiro Watsuki, whom he assisted in making the manga Rurouni Kenshin. Watsuki was pleased with Luffy's characterization and advised Oda to briefly change him for the main series to make it look like Luffy is always acting on his own free will.[15] To please his readers, Oda added rubberization to Luffy for comic effect[13] and tries to make the character straightforward.[16] In retrospect, Watsuki felt characters like Luffy reflect a trend of heroes who do not kill their enemies similar to his character Himura Kenshin.[17]</p1>

    <h3>Voice Actors</h3>
<div>    
    <p1>In the original Japanese version of the One Piece anime series and later spin-offs of the franchise, Luffy is voiced by Mayumi Tanaka.[18] Tanaka said jokingly that she regrets providing Luffy's voice because she is a mother in real life and Luffy is much younger.[19] Asked about her voicing, Tanaka said that she "strives for reality" in scenes where Luffy speaks when he is eating or touching his nose.[20] In the OVA Defeat the Pirate Ganzack!, Luffy was voiced by Urara Takano.[21]</p1></div>   
<div>
    <p2>The character was voiced by Erica Schroeder in 4kids Entertainment's English-language dubs of the franchise, starting in 2004, until Funimation acquired the franchise in 2007.</p2></div>    
<div>
    <p3>The character is voiced by Colleen Clinkenbeard in Funimation's English-language dubs of the One Piece franchise.[22]</p3></div>
